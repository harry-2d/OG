                                The International tournament area at Gamescom 2011
                                Valve Corporation announced the first edition of The International on August 1, 2011. 16 teams were invited to compete in the tournament, which would also serve as the first public viewing of Dota 2, and it was streamed online with commentary in four languages; English, Chinese, German, and Russian. The tournament was funded by Valve, including the $1 million USD grand prize, with Nvidia supplying the hardware.[25][26] It took place at Gamescom in Cologne from August 17–21 the same year.[11]
                                
                                The tournament started with a group stage in which the winners of each of the four groups were entered into a winner's bracket, and the other teams entered the loser's bracket. The rest of the tournament was then played as a double-elimination tournament.[27] The final of this first tournament was between Ukrainian team Natus Vincere and Chinese team EHOME, with Natus Vincere winning the grand prize after beating EHOME in three out of the four matches.[28] EHOME, who finished as the event's runner-up, won US$250,000 with the rest of the teams splitting the remaining 350,000.[29]
                                
                                The tournament was the central focus of the 2014 documentary Free to Play, which explored the lives of three of the players.[30</div> </div>

                                The International 2018 was held at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada from August 20–25, 2018.[21] The location change was due to the KeyArena undergoing renovation construction at the time.[60] As another change from previous Internationals, it featured a series of tournaments, running from October 2017 until June 2018 and known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), that awarded qualifying points with the top eight ranking teams receiving direct invitations.[61][62][63][64][65][66] The grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3–2. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had came from the open qualifiers and were not favored in matches throughout the competition.

                                The International 2019 was held in Shanghai at the Mercedes-Benz Arena from August 20–25.[23] There, OG became the first repeat champion of an International by defeating Team Liquid in the grand finals 3-1.[67]</div> </div>
