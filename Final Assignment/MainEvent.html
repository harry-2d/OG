                                            <p class="p1">Before we go the Playoffs Bracket, let's take a quick look at the two teams already eliminated. For Group A, Chaos Esports Club had to say goodbye to the tournament. We here at Player.One put Chaos as a dark horse for a possible Upper Bracket entry banking on the fact that they signed up Lasse "MATUMBAMAN" Urpalainen. It appears the pressure of being in TI may have been too high for the team.

                                                    Group B saw the elimination of Ninjas in Pyjamas. The team has a good performance during the DPC Season. However, it appears they may not have been ready for TI. One could also argue that maybe OG trouncing them with the carry Io could have had a bigger negative impact than expected.
                                                    
                                                    LOWER BRACKET
                                                    
                                                    The teams in the Lower Bracket are those who placed 5th to 8th in their group. These are:
                                                    
                                                    Group A
                                                    Alliance
                                                    Mineski
                                                    Team Liquid
                                                    Keen Gaming
                                                    Group B
                                                    Infamous
                                                    Fnatic
                                                    Natus Vincere
                                                    Royal Never Give Up
                                                    The surprise for Group A is clearly Team Liquid. We had initially predicted they would finish with a higher placement. However, their performance so far in TI9 has not been what you would expect. For Group B, Infamous looks to be doing pretty well considering this is the first TI for its members. Fnatic being in the lower bracket is a surprise, although we did put OG as a dark horse and the three teams we picked to be in the upper placement were there.
                                                    
                                                    With that, the matchups for the Lower Bracket are: Alliance vs Royal Never Give Up
                                                    Fnatic vs Team Liquid
                                                    Infamous vs Keen Gaming
                                                    Mineski vs Natus Vincere
                                                    So who do we think is moving forward?
                                                    
                                                    In the first match-up, we are going with Alliance, mainly considering that the performance of RNG has not been that consistent lately. In their group matches, Alliance was 2-0 against Keen Gaming and 0-2 versus Secret. In all other match ups Alliance managed to get a tie. RNG meanwhile got pretty beaten up, but its wins against Na'Vi and NiP helped the team to stay afloat.
                                                    
                                                    The second match-up is rather difficult. Liquid hasn't been performing as well and one could argue that Fnatic had the luck of being in the "stronger" group. Given that, we'll have to say its Fnatic as they appear to have the drive to move to the next round.
                                                    
                                                    We'll go with Infamous over Keen Gaming for the third match, given how the team has been performing in the Group Stage.
                                                    
                                                    For the final match-up, we choose Mineski. Despite a rather rocky start, Mineski has shown to perform well when it counts.</p>

                                                    <p class="p1">The teams that placed in the top four are:

                                                            Group A
                                                            PSG.LGD
                                                            Team Secret
                                                            TNC Predator
                                                            Newbee
                                                            Group B
                                                            OG
                                                            Vici Gaming
                                                            Evil Geniuses
                                                            Virtus.pro
                                                            For Group A, our picks weren’t that far off. The only difference was that we chose Liquid, and they didn’t perform that well during the Group Stage. We also got most of Group B right. While we went for Fnatic to enter the top four, we had predicted that OG could be the dark horse for the group and they were indeed.
                                                            
                                                            For the Upper Bracket, the matchups are:
                                                            
                                                            PSG.LGD vs Virtus.pro
                                                            Vici Gaming vs TNC Predator
                                                            OG vs Newbee
                                                            Evil Geniuses vs Team Secret
                                                            Of the five Major tournaments, VP won in one and placed in the top four in three of them. PSG.LGD, meanwhile, has only reached the top four in two of the Major tournaments. Both teams have had consistent performances. For this match-up we're going with PSG.LGD, as they appear to have prepared well for TI.
                                                            
                                                            TNC has been known to be an underdog with a tendency to surprise. This time around though we are choosing VG, as the team has been doing good so far.
                                                            
                                                            OG is on a roll, so we choose OG for this match-up. Yes, Newbee, or should we say the former Forward Gaming, has been a surprise, but they need to find a way to deal with OG's surprise picks if they are to move forward in the Upper Bracket.
                                                            
                                                            This last match-up is a bit difficult as both Secret and EG are truly strong teams. Considering what has been happening in this past season, our choice for this one is Secret. Secret has a tendency to "experiment" with their picks even in a tournament. Remember the Luna support pick? EG is typically known to follow the meta when it comes to picks. They need to be a bit more creative if they want to come out on top against Secret.
                                                            
                                                            To sum it up, here are the matchups are our picks:

                                                            Fnatic vs Team Liquid: Fnatic
