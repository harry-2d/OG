                                        <p style="color:white;">THE INTERNATIONAL 2019 (TI9): MAIN EVENT OF THE YEAR</p>
                                        <p class="p1">The international 2019 has reached the highest pool prize i.e. 33 million+(33,687,987) till now.It is the highest pool price money in the esport history <br> Interesting facts about the teams<br> The reason why we only have one team from North America this season is because the second one, Forward Gaming, had to release their roster due to financial problems and the group got acquired by the Chinese giant Newbee. The organization was lacking a TI 9 team this year and since the event takes place on their home soil for the first time since its inception, the management probably regarded the opportunity to sign Forward Gaming’s roster as being worthwhile.
    
                                            Natus Vincere and Alliance have both returned to The International, a tournament they once won, after a two year absence. Perhaps with a little bit of luck, we may even see them compete against each other at the event. Should that happen, Alliance will almost certainly win the dispute, being much stronger than Na’Vi at this point.
                                            
                                            Chaos Esports Club, a team that’s carried by the former carry player of Team Liquid, is present at the event and probably longs for revenge. The roster’s captain is MISERY, who is known for his fantastic TI performances. In 2016, he and his team of rejects and rebels managed to qualify for the Grand Final of the event.
                                            
                                            And finally, one last piece of information that’s worth mentioning at this point is that Heen, the former coach of Team Liquid, will be present with his new team, TNC Predator, at The International 2019. Having seen them compete, I think they’ll get a top six result at the competition.</p>

                                        <p style="color:white;">THE EPIC-CENTER:</p>
                                        <p class="p1"> German enterprise application software firm SAP has become the official partner of the EPICENTER Major Dota 2 series.<br>partnering with an IT brand specialising in collecting in-game data and statistics for pro esports teams is a first for the EPICENTER series.
    
                                            According to the company, SAP’s technology collects and displays in-game figures such as net worth*, patch records and other useful facts in real time, connecting them to esports tournament broadcasts. It allows fans, observers and broadcasters a bigger picture experience, giving them a better understanding of esports athletes’ decisions, especially in less intuitive games like Dota 2.
                                            
                                            Discussing the partnership, Partner Manager and Innovation lead at SAP, Milan Cerny, said:
                                            
                                            “With 117 different heroes with completely different abilities, there are thousands of different constellations that make sure that no two Dota games are the same,
                                            “At the EPICENTER Major, we continue to provide value to fans of the Dota Pro Circuit by putting context to in-game data analysis and enhance the experience during all phases of each game.”
                                            While ESforce Holding Commercial Director, Alexander Kim, added:
                                            
                                            “It is difficult to imagine modern professional football, basketball or hockey without nuanced and detailed statistical analysis. Correct information processing is often key to great achievements and genius coaching decisions.
                                            “Products offered by SAP to esports will not only increase broadcast quality for the viewers of our major tournaments, but also elevate esports industry to a completely new professional level.”
                                            As a rule, esports involves a much great volume of data than traditional sports, and this is standardised and available via the developer’s API**.  The SAP-developed cloud-based analytics solution, based on their SAP HANA platform, allows esports athletes to review their opponents’ in-game strategies – picks and bans, players’ hero win ratios etc – faster and more effectively.
                                            
                                            A streamlined replay review process is another function of the SAP esports application, automating what can otherwise be a very time-consuming process. The first team to use SAP’s analytical platform was Team Liquid in 2018.  <br>

                                        <p style="color:white;">ESL ONE HAMBURG 2019:</p>
                                        <p class="p1"> oming into the end of 2018, Team Secret were struggling to find huge success in any shape or form. They had placed 5th at ESL One Katowice and 3rd at ESL One Genting at the start of the year, and in 8 months had only won one notable tournament. Bombing out of The International at 5th place, it was clear to many that Team Secret needed a serious reshuffle if things were to improve. The relatively unknown Nisha came into Pos 1, while the famous Swede zai was signed up for Pos 3. On paper it looked promising, but fans weren’t sure if the new team was enough to change Team Secret’s performance. What followed was the birth of one of the strongest Dota 2 teams ever seen- and it all started at ESL One Hamburg 2018. Despite losing to their arch-enemies Virtus.pro in the early stages of the Upper Bracket, Team Secret brought it back by destroying EG and paiN Gaming 2-0 in the Lower Bracket, culminating in a Lower Bracket Finals between them and Virtus.pro. This time, Team Secret weren’t going to be outdone. After wiping the CIS team 2-0, the newly-reshuffled team went on to beat Vici Gaming 3-2 in a nail-biting Grand Finals. Since then Team Secret has dominated the Dota 2 scene and won nearly every major tournament they’ve been a part of. </p>
